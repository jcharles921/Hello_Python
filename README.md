# Hello python 
## Description
This repository is dedicated to testing the Django framework in preparation for my upcoming exam project. The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the various features and functionalities provided by Django and to gain practical experience in building web applications.
## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- project/
    - README.md
    - manage.py
    - myapp/
        - __init__.py
        - settings.py
        - urls.py

## Installation

## Next steps

While testing the Django framework, I plan to add a new module to this project. The module will aim to enhance the functionality of the web application and demonstrate my understanding of Django concepts. I will continue to update this repository as I progress with my exam project, implementing new features and refining existing ones.
